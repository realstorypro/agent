# This is Homebrew (https://brew.sh) formula to install Crawlera
# Headless Proxy on your Mac. Installation is quite straghtforward:
#
# To install release version, please run:
#   $ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scrapinghub/crawlera-headless-proxy/master/crawlera-headless-proxy.rb
#
# If you wanr to install development version, please use HEAD:
#   $ bew install --HEAD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scrapinghub/crawlera-headless-proxy/master/crawlera-headless-proxy.rb
#
# Also, there is one optional parameter: --with-upx
# With this parameter, headless-proxy will be compressed by UPX
# (https://upx.github.io). This will give you a smaller binary size but
# as a side-effect, installation time will be much longer than simple
# installation.
